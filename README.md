Exploring the Nexus Between Economic Policy Uncertainty, Geopolitical Risk, and CO₂ Emissions

### 📘 Overview

This research investigates the intricate relationship between economic policy uncertainty, geopolitical risk, and CO₂ emissions, with a special focus on BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa). Using a combination of econometric and machine learning models, the study uncovers how macroeconomic and environmental indicators jointly influence energy consumption trends and sustainability outcomes.

### 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze the impact of economic policy uncertainty and geopolitical risk on CO₂ emissions.

* Examine the correlation between GDP, inflation, energy consumption, and environmental indicators.

* Provide actionable insights for policymakers towards sustainable energy management.


### 🧩 Methodology

* Data Filtering & EDA: Pandas-based preprocessing and visualization.

* Regression Models: OLS, Fixed Effects, and Random Effects models for panel data analysis.

* Machine Learning Models: Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regression for non-linear relationships.

* Time-Series Analysis: ARIMA model to capture temporal emission trends.

* Model Validation: Hausman Test for model selection and comparison.

### 📊 Key Findings

* Strong positive correlation between CO₂ emissions and energy consumption.

* Economic policy uncertainty and inflation significantly affect consumption patterns.

* Fixed-effects model identified as the most suitable approach for this dataset.


### 🧠 Tools & Technologies

* Languages: Python (Pandas, StatsModels, Scikit-learn), STATA

* Techniques: Regression Analysis, ARIMA, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

* Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn


### 📌 Conclusion

The study highlights how geopolitical risk and economic uncertainty shape environmental outcomes, emphasizing the need for data-driven policies to promote sustainable development and energy resilience.
