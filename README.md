Exploring the Nexus Between Economic Policy Uncertainty, Geopolitical Risk, and CO₂ Emissions

### 📘 Overview

This research investigates the intricate relationship between economic policy uncertainty, geopolitical risk, and CO₂ emissions, with a special focus on BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa). Using a combination of econometric and machine learning models, the study uncovers how macroeconomic and environmental indicators jointly influence energy consumption trends and sustainability outcomes.

### 🎯 Objectives
```
Analyze the impact of economic policy uncertainty and geopolitical risk on CO₂ emissions.

Examine the correlation between GDP, inflation, energy consumption, and environmental indicators.

Provide actionable insights for policymakers towards sustainable energy management.
```

### 🧩 Methodology
```
Data Filtering & EDA: Pandas-based preprocessing and visualization.

Regression Models: OLS, Fixed Effects, and Random Effects models for panel data analysis.
